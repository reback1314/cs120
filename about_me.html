    <h2>Trip or Getaway</h2>
    <p>
        This summer, I accompanied my family on a two-week tour of several cities in the eastern United States, including New York, Philadelphia, and Washington. We visited the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Independence Palace, the Lincoln Memorial, the White House and other classic attractions, which made me appreciate the rich history and culture of the United States, the diversified art atmosphere, and the prosperity and vitality of the modern city. This trip not only broadened my horizons, but also gave me a better understanding of America's past and present.

        My favorite restaurant is:
        <a href="https://www.santouka-usa.com/locations" target="_blank">Santouka</a>
    <p>
        I really like Hokkaido Ramen Yamato, mainly because its soup base is really heartfelt, made with pork bone simmered for a long time, which is flavourful without being too heavy to drink. Its ramen is lighter and healthier, with good salt control, so it's not much of a burden to eat. The founder has always insisted on making ramen that is suitable for the whole family, a philosophy that one finds quite thoughtful.

        My favourite food is the sashimi platter, which I like to arrange on a delicate tray with some decorative shiso leaves, shredded white radish and lemon slices, which is both aesthetically pleasing and enhances the taste. When I eat it, I like to dip it in a little soy sauce and wasabi first, then slowly savour the fresh sweetness and delicacy of each piece of sashimi. Salmon is fatty, tuna is tender and sweet prawns are fresh and sweet, and each sashimi has a unique taste that lingers in your mouth. After eating a few slices of sashimi, a refreshing bite of sliced ginger clears the palate and enhances the taste experience. To finish, a glass of chilled sake is the perfect treat!
