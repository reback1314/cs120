        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Hailing from different cities, with different scars, but brought together by music, Vesper Noir's vocals,
            Elias Frost's cool arrangements, Zane Vex's wild guitars, and Ryder Blush's rhythmic drums have combined to
            create a soul-stirring musical storm. Their first show was in an abandoned station in Tokyo late at night,
            where thousands of people flocked to hear the awakening of ‘Night of Souls’. Now they are on a world tour,
            bringing their music to every sleepless soul in the world.

                <p class="p3">Birthplace: Sapporo, Hokkaido</p>
                <p class="p4">Personality: Calm and collected, perfectionistic to the point of obsession, cold exterior
                    but warm inside.</p></br>
                <p class="p5">Story Snippet: Elias Frost, born Shiro Suu, is a pianist whose music is described as
                    weaving poems of coldness and passion between the black and white keys. A musical prodigy since
                    childhood, his experimental style, blending classical and electronic music, was deemed "blasphemy to
                    classical music" at the Vienna Conservatory. Tragedy struck with the early death of his equally
                    gifted programmer sister. Her last code became an integral part of his keyboard, generating melodies
                    in her style with every performance, as if her soul lived on through music. Expelled from the
                    conservatory after a rebellious performance, he wandered the world, collecting piano strings to
                    build a massive metal harp for spirit's melodies. Meeting Vesper Noir and hearing her voice
                    rekindled his belief in the power of music.</p>

                <p class="p5">Story Snippet: Ryder Blush, born Sakuraji, was once a gifted gymnast, even on the path to
                    the Olympics. A severe competition error ended his gymnastics career, crushing his dreams. During
                    recovery, he discovered percussion, finding rhythm and heartbeat in drumming. He abandoned his past
                    to become a drummer. He trains with dumbbells to enhance his drumming power and practices in a
                    soundproof gym-turned-studio. His performances blend gymnastics and music. He also anonymously runs
                    an emotional radio station, helping people express themselves through drum rhythms.</p>

                <p class="p5">Story Snippet: Zane Vex, born Honjou, is a guitarist whose guitar ignites notes in the
                    whirlwind, letting the broken world hear the cry for freedom. Growing up in a motorcycle gang in
                    Osaka, he was more devoted to motorcycle customization than guitar practice. His grandmother, a
                    shrine maiden, gave him a talisman hoping for his life's purpose, which he found in the roar of
                    engines and soul-shaking music. Discovered after creating captivating sounds by striking steel bars
                    on a construction site, Vesper Noir recruited him. His stage antics include tearing antique shirts,
                    symbolizing the collapse of the old world. He has 12 earrings in his left ear, each representing a
                    city where he listened to street sounds and translated them into his guitar music.</p>

                    blade in the night, cutting through silence and awakening dormant souls. Orphaned and raised by a
                    kind orphanage director, Rin inherited a silver chain with an ancient wolf totem, a memento and a
                    cryptic guide for her life's journey. She started her musical journey in underground clubs, her
                    husky and sharp voice expressing her loneliness and anger. Discovered by a music producer, she
                    became a star, yet remains grounded, feeding stray cats in the back alleys of her record company and
                    cherishing her silver harmonica—a link to her unknown jazz musician father, whom she continues to
                    search for, much like her own voice.</p>
