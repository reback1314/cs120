        <h1>Abot Us</h1>
        <!-- <h2>这里可以放一些简短的介绍文字</h2> -->
        <p>Under the neon night sky of Tokyo, four young people with intertwined destinies use music to portray their past and future. Their band ANIMA NOX is derived from the Latin word for ‘night of the soul’, symbolising their search for themselves in the darkness. Their music is a fusion of electro-industrial, dark opera, symphonic metal, future jazz, etc. Each song is like an untold story. Carrying their own scars, they found empathy in their music and eventually formed a legendary band that swept the world. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)</p>

                <p>slowly savour the fresh sweetness and delicacy of each piece of sashimi. Salmon is fatty, tuna is

                    your mouth. After eating a few slices of sashimi, a refreshing bite of sliced ginger clears the
                    palate and enhances the taste experience. To finish, a glass of chilled sake is the perfect treat!
